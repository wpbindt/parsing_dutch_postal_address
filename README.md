# Parsing Dutch postal addresses using applicative parsers
This is an example of using the Python `functional_parsing_library` library to parse a simple grammar specified in Backus-Naur form.
To try it out, you can run `try_it_out.sh` in the root of this repository. Be aware that it builds a Docker image which installs
`functional_parsing_library==0.0.27`, so you may want to look at its source code [here](https://github.com/wpbindt/functional_parsing_library/tree/0.0.27).
